# P07-Iterable-Song-Player
This assignment involves the development of a collection of songs as a doubly linked list named
Iterable Song Player. The final application will allow the user to play through the collection
of songs in different directions (forward and backward). To do so, you are going to create two
kinds of iterators to step through the songs. In addition, the user will be able to add and
remove songs at different orders. Through the process of completing this assignment, you will
get practice utilizing the Iterator and Iterable interfaces from the Java API. You will also get
practice implementing a doubly linked list, and tester methods to help you gain confidence that
your code works as intended.
